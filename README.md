# Medical-Debt-and-Healthcare-Utilization-Analysis-
Analyzed SIPP 2023 data in R using logistic and negative binomial regression to examine the impact of medical debt on healthcare utilization and mental health among U.S. adults

Medical debt is a powerful marker of structural inequity in the U.S. healthcare system. Unlike other forms of debt, medical debt is rarely incurred by choice and often reflects structural deficiencies in insurance coverage, and public health infrastructure. Individuals from low-income and historically marginalized communities are disproportionately affected, facing heightened risks of financial hardship, stress, and delayed or forgone medical care.

Despite the scale and impact of debt relief efforts, the broader consequences of medical debt on healthcare utilization, mental health, and persistent disparities remain underexplored in policy and research. For example, does abolishing medical debt encourage people to return for needed care? Are there meaningful differences in how medical debt affects access to care and stress across demographic groups? And how should financial wellness be measured beyond conventional credit metrics?

My lab is partnering with Undue Medical Debt (UMD), a nonprofit that has abolished over $15 billion in medical debt for more than 10 million low-income and vulnerable Americans since 2014, to generate evidence on the broader impacts of debt relief beyond credit score improvements. In this project, I will leverage 2023 panel of Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data to examine the relationships between medical debt, healthcare utilization, and mental health. In specific, (1) does owing medical debt reduce an individualâ€™s likelihood of seeking medical care? (2) how this effect varies by race, sex, and income, and (3) the association between debt burden and psychological distress. Clarifying these relationships will inform targeted policies and interventions to alleviate financial stress, improve access, and prevent avoidable health complications.

## Result Summary
This analysis provides some new evidence on the relationship between medical debt and healthcare utilization in the United States. Contrary to my original hypothesis, the results consistently show that individuals with medical debt are actually more likely to seek medical care than those without debt, both in terms of the probability of having any doctor visit and in the frequency of visits among those who do see a provider. This likely reflects that people who develop medical debt often do so precisely because they have higher and ongoing health needs, rather than because debt deters care outright.

Additional models found that the association between debt and doctor visits does not significantly differ by income, and there was no statistically significant link between medical debt and self-reported mental or emotional disorders after controlling for demographics. Among those with medical debt, having a higher debt amount is associated with more doctor visits, though the effect size is modest and the pattern is not strictly linear. Descriptive plots suggest that, at the highest debt levels, some individuals may be limiting further care, possibly due to financial exhaustion or barriers, though this pattern could also be due to sample size or random variation.

Overall, these findings highlight the complex relationship between financial barriers and healthcare utilization. While medical debt does not appear to prevent care for most people, it is closely linked to higher healthcare use, likely reflecting the chronic or acute health conditions that both drive and result from debt. These results suggest that policies focused solely on debt relief may not fully address the underlying health needs that lead to debt accumulation, and that ongoing monitoring and support for high-need populations is essential.
